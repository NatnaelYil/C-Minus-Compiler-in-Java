Description

Project, one uses the grammar definition in the appendix of our text book to guide and construct a lexical analyzer. 
This lexical analyzer will return a token that will serve as input to the parser.
In order to execute this program, go to an empty dir

Project 1 run by reading each line from a text/input/file.
The main class passes that file for lexical analysis by calling the parse method the Lexical class.
This method will read each the parse method calls the Lex() to run lexical analysis. This method will perform the analysis by following this steps;
o	Check to see if the current line is a comment 
o	If yes..continue until the end
o	Go to a while loop to read each character
o	If the character is tab, space, or new line move to the next value until it is not
o	If a character is a start of a comment
o	Check to see if it is a line comment
o	If yes exist the loop and move to the next line in the file.
o	if it is a nest loop consume it until you reached the end
o	if it a character consume the next values until you reach empty/EOL/different char
o	identify if it is a keyword/Id and print
o	if it is a number check to see if it a floating number or decimal and print
o	if there are errors in the process print them.
o	It uses methods like
o	Specialsymboleidf-to identify special symbols hard coded into the program
o	Identify - to know if a work is a keyword or an ID
o	Error - to print identify and print error strings in the line
o	Its continues until it reaches EOL
