Description

Project, one uses the grammar definition in the appendix of our text book to guide and construct a Syntax analyzer. 
This lexical analyzer will return a token that will serve as input to the parser. The parser then takes these token 
and check whether or not they have syntax correctness and build the symbol table on the way.  The syntax analysis class,
 if it found the program to be correct, it will print Accept or Reject if the program has an error.

Project 2 runs by taking the tokens from the lexical analysis, the lexical analysis adds ‘$’ character at the end of 
the token array to tell the parser that it has reached the end of the file/tokens.
The main class passes that file for lexical analysis by calling the parse method the Lexical class. The lexical analysis
 then calls syn() method of syntax analyzer class to run the analysis.
This method will read each tokens passed as an array and perform a top-down parse tree for semantics analysis. 
This method will perform the analysis by following this steps;
•	Data Structures used- Stack -> to store special symbols as we go down the tree 
 			-symbol table-  a hash table used to store ID’s after declaration
•	The program starts my calling declarationlist fun()
•	If it returns true- accept the program or else reject it
•	Declarationlist- calls variable declaration or function declaration functions
•	Variabledeclaration checks to see if there are any global variables (int , int []) being declared
•	Function declaration checks to see if there is a function declaration and calls compound statement if it finds one
•	Compoundstmt function checks to see if its a start of a compound statement and calls local declaration 
	and statement list function for analysis.
•	Local declaration checks for local variable declared and if there isn’t any, goes to empty and pass the token to statementlist
•	Statementlist function checks to see if its and expression statement or a compound statement or selection 
	statement or and iteration statement or a return statement 
•	Expression statement checks to see if it an expression or ‘ ;’
•	Selectionstmt function checks to see if it and ‘if’ statement of and “if…else” statement 
•	Iterationstmt function checks if its “while” statement
•	Returnstmt function checks if it a return zero or return with an expression
•	Expression function checks if it is an assignment statement or a simple expression
•	Simple expression checks if it is an additive expression relop additive expression or just an additive expression
•	Relop function checks if the current token is of “<=, <, >, >=, ==, !=” used for comparing variables
•	Additiveexpression function checks of it a term or a an addition expression
•	Term function checks if it is a factor or mulop statement 
•	Mulop function checks if it is a multiplication or division expression
•	Factor checks if it is a parenthesized expression or just a variable or a function call or number
•	A function call checks if it has an argument or an expression of argument
